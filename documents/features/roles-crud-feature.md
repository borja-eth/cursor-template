# Product Requirements Document: Role Management Tool (CRUD with Permissions)

## Overview
The Role Management Tool is a feature designed to manage user roles within an application. This tool will allow administrators to create, read, update, and delete roles. Additionally, it will provide the functionality to assign specific permissions to each role, ensuring granular control over user access within the system.

## Objectives
1. Enable administrators to manage user roles effectively.
2. Allow the assignment of granular permissions to roles.
3. Provide error checks and feedback for robust operation.
4. Ensure user-friendly navigation and clear feedback for all actions.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Role Management (CRUD)
#### 1.1 Create a Role
- **Steps:**
  1. Navigate to the "Roles" section in the admin panel.
  2. Click on the "Create Role" button.
  3. Enter the role name (mandatory).
  4. Add a description of the role (optional).
  5. Select permissions to assign to the role (optional but recommended).
  6. Click "Save" to create the role.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Role name is left blank.
  - Role name duplicates an existing role.
  - Permissions selected are invalid or conflict with application logic.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Display error messages for invalid inputs (e.g., "Role name is required" or "Role name already exists").
  - Provide inline validation for the role name field.
  - Log error details for debugging.

#### 1.2 Read/View Roles
- **Steps:**
  1. Navigate to the "Roles" section.
  2. View a list of all roles with associated details (e.g., name, description, number of users assigned).
  3. Click on a role to see detailed permissions.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - No roles exist in the system.
  - Permissions assigned to a role have been removed from the system.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Display "No roles available" when the list is empty.
  - Highlight permissions flagged as invalid.
  - Log missing data scenarios.

#### 1.3 Update a Role
- **Steps:**
  1. Navigate to the "Roles" section.
  2. Click on the "Edit" button for a specific role.
  3. Update the role name, description, or permissions.
  4. Click "Save" to confirm changes.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Attempt to update the role name to one that already exists.
  - Remove all permissions from a role, rendering it ineffective.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Display confirmation prompts for critical updates (e.g., removing all permissions).
  - Validate input fields before saving.
  - Log changes for auditing purposes.

#### 1.4 Delete a Role
- **Steps:**
  1. Navigate to the "Roles" section.
  2. Click on the "Delete" button for a specific role.
  3. Confirm the deletion via a pop-up dialog.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Attempt to delete a role currently assigned to users.
  - Deleting default or system-critical roles.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Prevent deletion of system-critical roles.
  - Display warnings for roles assigned to users, including the number of affected users.
  - Log deletion attempts and outcomes.

### 2. Permission Management
#### 2.1 Assign Permissions to a Role
- **Steps:**
  1. Navigate to the "Roles" section.
  2. Click on a role to edit.
  3. Select or deselect permissions from a predefined list.
  4. Save changes to confirm updates.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Invalid or incompatible permissions are assigned.
  - Assigning permissions that conflict with existing roles.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Display validation messages for incompatible selections.
  - Log and flag invalid permission combinations.

#### 2.2 View Assigned Permissions
- **Steps:**
  1. Navigate to the "Roles" section.
  2. Click on a role to view its details.
  3. Display the list of assigned permissions.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Permissions referenced in the role no longer exist in the system.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Highlight invalid or missing permissions.
  - Provide a mechanism to update and resolve invalid permissions.

### 3. User Interface (UI)
#### 3.1 Role List Page
- Display all roles with key details (e.g., name, description, user count).
- Provide action buttons for CRUD operations.

#### 3.2 Role Detail Page
- Show detailed information about a role, including assigned permissions.
- Include options to edit or delete the role.

#### 3.3 Role Creation/Editing Form
- Input fields for role name and description.
- Permission selection (checkbox or multi-select dropdown).
- Validation messages for incorrect inputs.

#### 3.4 Confirmation Dialogs
- Display for critical actions like deleting a role.
- Include descriptive text to clarify the consequences of the action.

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance:**
   - Ensure the UI loads role and permission data in under 2 seconds.
2. **Scalability:**
   - Support up to 10,000 roles and permissions without performance degradation.
3. **Security:**
   - Restrict access to the Role Management Tool to authorized administrators.
   - Log all CRUD operations for auditing.

## Error Logging and Feedback
- Log all errors with contextual information for debugging.
- Provide clear, actionable error messages to users.
- Ensure logs do not expose sensitive information.

## Testing Considerations
1. Test the tool with a large number of roles and permissions to evaluate performance.
2. Validate edge cases for CRUD operations.
3. Ensure user feedback is clear and accurate.
4. Conduct security tests to prevent unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

## Documentation and Training
1. Provide a user manual with step-by-step instructions for administrators.
2. Include tooltips and inline help within the UI for better usability.
3. Offer training sessions or tutorials for new users.

## Future Enhancements
1. Role hierarchy to allow inheritance of permissions.
2. Bulk import/export of roles and permissions.
3. Role templates for quick setup of common configurations.
