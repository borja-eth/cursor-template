# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Permission Management Feature

## Overview
The Permission Management feature enables administrators to manage (Create, Read, Update, Delete) user permissions within the application. This ensures proper access control, enhances security, and provides flexibility for assigning or revoking user capabilities. The feature integrates seamlessly with the application's existing authentication and user management systems.

## Objectives
1. Provide administrators with a user-friendly interface to manage permissions.
2. Ensure that permissions are consistently enforced across the application.
3. Allow granular control over access to features and resources.
4. Implement safeguards to prevent unauthorized changes or errors.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. **Permission Types**
Permissions define access rights to specific features or resources in the application. Examples include:
- Read-only access to a resource.
- Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities.
- Access to specific modules or areas.

Administrators should:
- View a list of all available permission types.
- Create custom permission types as needed.

---

### 2. **User Roles**
Permissions can be assigned directly to users or grouped into roles for easier management. Roles:
- Represent a collection of permissions.
- Simplify assignment by grouping related permissions (e.g., "Admin," "Editor," "Viewer").

Administrators should:
- View and manage roles.
- Assign roles to users.

---

### 3. **CRUD Operations on Permissions**
#### **3.1 Create Permissions**
- Allow administrators to define new permissions.
- Specify permission scope (e.g., resource-specific, global).
- Include validation to prevent duplicate or conflicting permissions.

#### **3.2 Read Permissions**
- Display a detailed view of existing permissions.
- Filter permissions by type, role, or user.
- Support audit logs to track changes to permissions.

#### **3.3 Update Permissions**
- Enable modification of existing permissions.
- Validate changes to avoid conflicts or unintended access.
- Notify users affected by permission updates.

#### **3.4 Delete Permissions**
- Allow removal of unused or obsolete permissions.
- Ensure a permission is not assigned to any role or user before deletion.
- Archive permissions before permanent deletion for audit purposes.

---

### 4. **Assignment & Revocation**
- Administrators can assign permissions directly to users or through roles.
- Support bulk assignment/revocation for efficiency.
- Include checks to ensure roles or permissions do not conflict.

---

### 5. **Error Handling and Notifications**
#### **5.1 Error Scenarios**
- Duplicate permission names.
- Conflicting permissions assigned to the same user.
- Attempting to delete a permission in use.
- Invalid input during creation or updates.

#### **5.2 Notification System**
- Inform administrators of successful operations (e.g., "Permission updated successfully").
- Provide detailed error messages for failures (e.g., "Permission cannot be deleted as it is assigned to active roles").

---

### 6. **Audit and Logging**
- Maintain logs for all changes to permissions, roles, and assignments.
- Include information such as:
  - Who made the change.
  - Timestamp of the change.
  - Details of the change (e.g., "Added 'Edit' permission to 'Editor' role").

- Ensure logs are secure and tamper-proof.

---

### 7. **User Interface Requirements**
#### **7.1 Permission Management Interface**
- Dashboard displaying a list of all permissions with filtering and sorting options.
- Forms for creating and editing permissions.
- Confirmation modals for critical actions (e.g., deletion).

#### **7.2 Role Management Interface**
- View and manage roles.
- Drag-and-drop functionality to add/remove permissions from roles.

#### **7.3 User Assignment Interface**
- View user-specific permissions and roles.
- Assign/revoke permissions or roles from individual users.

---

### 8. **Performance and Scalability**
- Ensure the system performs well with a large number of users and permissions.
- Optimize queries for filtering and searching permissions.
- Support role hierarchies if needed (e.g., "Super Admin" inherits all "Admin" permissions).

---

### 9. **Security Considerations**
- Restrict access to permission management features to authorized administrators.
- Use secure APIs to prevent tampering or unauthorized access.
- Encrypt sensitive data related to permissions.

---

## Edge Cases
1. **Conflicting Permissions:** Prevent users from having contradictory permissions (e.g., "Read-only" and "Edit" for the same resource).
2. **Orphaned Permissions:** Identify and handle permissions that are no longer assigned to any user or role.
3. **Simultaneous Updates:** Handle concurrent modifications to permissions gracefully (e.g., two admins editing the same permission).
4. **Bulk Operations:** Validate all items in bulk actions to avoid partial failures.
5. **Dependency Management:** Ensure dependencies are respected when modifying or deleting permissions (e.g., roles depending on a permission).

---

## Success Metrics
1. Reduction in errors related to incorrect or missing permissions.
2. Improved administrator efficiency in managing permissions and roles.
3. High adoption rate of permission management features by administrators.
4. Minimal support requests related to permission management.
