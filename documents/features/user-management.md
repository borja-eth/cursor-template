# Product Requirements Document: User Management Feature

## Overview
The user management feature enables administrators to view a list of users and manage their roles efficiently. This document outlines the functional requirements, workflow, and considerations for implementing this feature. The focus is on providing a seamless, intuitive experience while ensuring robust error handling and logging mechanisms.

## Functional Scope

1. **View User List**
   - Display a paginated list of all registered users.
   - Provide basic information for each user (e.g., name, email, role, and status).
   - Allow filtering and searching by user attributes such as name, email, or role.
   - Include sort options (e.g., alphabetical order, role, or creation date).

2. **Manage User Roles**
   - Allow an admin to view detailed information about a specific user.
   - Provide functionality to assign, modify, or remove user roles.
   - Include a confirmation step for changes to prevent accidental modifications.
   - Ensure proper access controls: Only authorized administrators can modify roles.

## Functional Details

### 1. Viewing the User List
#### Workflow
1. **User Interface (UI):**
   - A dedicated "User Management" section within the admin panel.
   - The page should display a table containing the following columns:
     - User Name
     - Email Address
     - Role
     - Account Status (e.g., Active, Inactive, Suspended)
     - Actions (e.g., View Details, Manage Roles)
   - A search bar and filter dropdown should be positioned at the top of the page.

2. **Pagination:**
   - Load a maximum of 20 users per page by default.
   - Include navigation controls (e.g., Next, Previous, specific page numbers).

3. **Filters and Search:**
   - Dropdown menu for role-based filtering (e.g., Admin, Editor, Viewer).
   - Text-based search for querying names or emails.

4. **Sort Options:**
   - Allow sorting by columns such as Name, Email, Role, and Creation Date.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Empty State: Display a message like "No users found" if the list is empty.
   - Loading State: Display a loading spinner when fetching user data.
   - Network Errors: Show an error message if the data fails to load.

### 2. Managing User Roles
#### Workflow
1. **Viewing User Details:**
   - When the admin selects "Manage Roles" from the Actions column:
     - Display a modal or navigate to a dedicated user details page.
     - Include user-specific details (e.g., Name, Email, Current Role, Account Status, and Last Login).

2. **Editing Roles:**
   - Provide a dropdown or multi-select field to assign one or multiple roles.
   - Validate input to ensure the selected roles adhere to organizational policies.

3. **Confirmation Step:**
   - Before saving changes, display a confirmation modal:
     - "Are you sure you want to update the role(s) for [User Name]?"
   - Include buttons for "Confirm" and "Cancel."

4. **Saving Changes:**
   - On confirmation, send the changes to the backend.
   - Display a success message upon successful update.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Display an error message if the update fails (e.g., "Unable to update roles. Please try again later.").
   - Handle conflicting role assignments with user-friendly error messages.

6. **Audit Logging:**
   - Log each role change with details such as admin ID, user ID, old roles, new roles, and timestamp.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - Attempting to manage roles for a nonexistent user: Display a "User not found" error.
   - Trying to assign restricted roles (e.g., Super Admin) without proper permissions: Show an "Access Denied" message.
   - Handling concurrent updates (e.g., two admins modifying roles simultaneously): Implement conflict resolution strategies and alert users if changes are outdated.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance:**
   - Ensure the user list loads within 2 seconds for up to 10,000 users.
   - Optimize backend queries to handle role updates efficiently.

2. **Security:**
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict role management to authorized admins.
   - Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

3. **Auditability:**
   - Maintain an activity log to track all role changes for compliance purposes.

4. **Localization:**
   - Support multiple languages for the UI if applicable.

---

## Testing & Validation

1. **Test Scenarios:**
   - Verify that the user list loads correctly with all expected attributes.
   - Ensure role management actions are reflected accurately in the database.
   - Test filters, sorting, and search functionality.
   - Validate error handling for edge cases and network failures.

2. **User Feedback:**
   - Conduct usability testing with admins to ensure the interface is intuitive.
   - Gather feedback on workflows for viewing and managing users.

---

## Documentation
1. Provide a detailed user guide for administrators.
2. Include tooltips and inline help for key actions (e.g., "Manage Roles" button).
