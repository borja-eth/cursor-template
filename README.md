# Roxom Cursor Template

## Introduction
If you are reading this, welcome! This is a template for Roxom Tools made with Next.js, DrizzleORM, TailwindCSS, and Spark UI (the components library of Roxom based on ShadnUI).

This template is meant to be used as a starting point for your own tool, and it includes all the necessary files and configurations to get started quickly:
- Basic project structure
- Next.js configuration
- TailwindCSS configuration
- DrizzleORM configuration
- Spark UI configuration
- Header and Navbar
- A `.cursorrules` file to be used with Cursor editor!

## Setup
1.  You need to have Node.js and Yarn installed on your machine. If you already have them installed, you can skip this step. If you don't have them installed, you can install them with the following commands:

```bash
# download and install Node.js
brew install node@20
# verifies the right Node.js version is in the environment
node -v # should print "v20.X.X"
# verifies the right npm version is in the environment
npm -v # should print "10.X.X"
```

2. Install project dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
